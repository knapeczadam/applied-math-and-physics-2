# 🌀 Applied Math and Physics 2

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or math-driven mind 👋  
Welcome to my **Applied Math and Physics 2** repository — a continuation of my mathematical journey during the **second semester (2023)** at **DAE**.

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **GeoGebra files** created for the **Applied Math and Physics 2** course.  
They were used to visualize and experiment with **mathematical concepts** fundamental to **real-time graphics** — including **quaternions**, **collisions**, **complex numbers**, and **rotations** in both 2D and 3D.

> ⚠️ Keep in mind: this repository contains **no executable content** — only **GeoGebra files**.  
> Many of them are **intentionally empty**, serving merely to make the **weekly folder structure visible** on GitHub.  
> Consider this repo a **visual record** of mathematical growth rather than a showcase of complete simulations.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This course bridges the gap between **abstract mathematics** and **real-time 3D programming** — from quaternions to collision systems.  
It’s where math finally stops being “theory” and becomes the invisible backbone of **smooth rotations**, **dynamic movement**, and **realistic physics** in games.  

If you’ve ever wondered *why the math matters* — this is the semester where you find out.
